My Portfolio: 
Welcome to my public portfolio hub! This repo serves as a central showcase for my projects, scripts, and experiments. Here, you'll find links to dedicated repositories with code, demos, and technical insights. My work emphasizes scalability, automation, and real-world reliability—perfect for exploring how I tackle full-stack challenges and AI research.

About Me:
I’m a builder working across the stack — from databases to mobile apps — with a focus on production-ready, reliable software.
I bring experience in software development, SRE, and project management, building systems that scale in real-world environments.

Currently developing a SaaS platform and running a small app-focused business, handling both the technical execution and product creation side.

Current Focus:
Production-grade SaaS systems
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
Mobile & web applications
Database design & architecture
Automation & scripting
AI research & robotics
Full-stack development
Project management & product delivery
These are my main current focus areas.
